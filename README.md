## Features

This code contains:

- Book management: Add books, get the ID and name of a book, and print the title of books in the library.
- User management: Add users and view user's details: ID, name and borrowed books.
- The interaction between book and user: User can borrow and return a book from the library, with additional features such as: stop an user from borrowing an unavailable book, stop an user from returning a book that they didn't borrow.

## What could have been done better

The code can't effectively manage a real library (lol). Here are some of the things that I think can be improve to "effectively manage a real library":

- Prevent borrowing or returning without books.
- The availability system, together with the borrow/ return interaction, still are flawed.

## What I learned after this project

- Constructor in a class
- Static variable/ static void
- Use pass by reference effectively
- Ternary operator

## Final words

Stupid ahh project
