## Features

This code contains:

1. Book management: Add books, get the ID and name of a book, and print the title of books in the library.
2. User management: Add users and view user's details: ID, name and borrowed books.
3. The interaction between book and user: User can borrow and return a book from the library, with additional features such as: stop an user from borrowing an unavailable book, stop an user from returning a book that they didn't borrow.

## What could have been done better

The code can't effectively manage a real library (lol). Here are some of the things that I think can be improve to "effectively manage a real library":

1. Prevent borrowing or returning without books.
2. The availability system, together with the borrow/ return interaction, still are flawed.


## What I learned

1. Constructor in a class
2. Static variable/ static void
3. Use pass by reference effectively
4. Ternary operator

## Final words

Please note that until 25/01/2025, I am not a real library manager. This code only serves as a mean of entertainment, and a way for me to learn OOP. Do not take this seriously.
